The single-player variant of Snake is a well-known and popular video game that requires a player to navigate a line-based representation of a snake through a two-dimensional playing area, while avoiding collisions with the walls of the playing area and the body of the snake itself.

A score and the snake length are increased whenever the snake is moved through items representing food.
