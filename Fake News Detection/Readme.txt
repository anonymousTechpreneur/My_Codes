The fake news on social media and various other media is wide spreading and is a
matter of serious concern due to its ability to cause a lot of social and national damage with
destructive impacts. A lot of research is already focused on detecting it. In order to create a model of a product with supervised
machine learning algorithm, that can classify fake news as true or false, by using tools like python
scikit-learn, NLP for textual analysis. This process will result in feature extraction and
vectorization; we propose using Python scikit-learn library to perform tokenization and feature
extraction of text data, because this library contains useful tools like Count Vectorizer and Tiff
Vectorizer. Then, we will perform feature selection methods, to experiment and choose the best
fit features to obtain the highest precision, according to confusion matrix results.
